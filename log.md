**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, built Header and Home component of my Amazon Clone.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. It is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress1**: Worked on my Amazon-clone project, completed "Home Page" design work and also started building "Checkout Page". 

**Today's Progress2**: Done some basic coding question on Coding Ninja platform which includes ques like comparison of two numbers, fibonacci series, counting digits that divide the number formed by them, etc., which involves basic concepts like if-else, switch, looping and pass by value and paas by refrence.

### Day 3: December 3, 2023 

**Today's Progress1**: In today's coding venture on my Amazon-clone project, I dedicated my efforts to refining the checkout page. The highlight was the integration of the React Context API, which facilitated the creation of a dynamic data framework. Leveraging this, I successfully implemented a smooth communication flow between componentsâ€”specifically, the ADD_TO_BUCKET button seamlessly pushes data to the data layer. Furthermore, the React Context API proved invaluable in effortlessly pulling data from the data layer to various components, enhancing the overall cohesion of the application. As the lines of code converged into a symphony of functionality, I marveled at the elegance of React and its transformative impact on the development process. Today's progress not only brings me closer to completing my Amazon-clone but also deepens my appreciation for the artistry of web development. Excitedly looking ahead to tomorrow's coding adventures and the continued evolution of my project.

**Today's Progress2**: Also, I focused on reinforcing coding basics and tackled three challenges on the Coding Ninjas platform: finding the sum of divisors, finding GCD and checking for prime numbers. The day ended on a high note as I secured a place among the top 11 coders on the weekly leaderboard. It was a fulfilling day of learning and achievement, setting the stage for more coding adventures ahead.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
